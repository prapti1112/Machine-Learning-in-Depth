# Software Implementations
This chapter focuses on the different basic programming paradigms that are required to implement machine learning algorithms through examples. The paradigms discussed are as follows:

1. Complete Search: Ex - Generate Power Set of [0, n)
2. Divide & Conquer: Ex - Binary Search
3. Greedy: Ex - Fractional Knapsack
4. Dynamic Programming: Ex - Binomial coefficient of expansion of (1 + x)^n
