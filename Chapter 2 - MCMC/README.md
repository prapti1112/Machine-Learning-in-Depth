## Monte Calro Markov Chains
This chapter gives an introduction of Monte Carlo Markov Chains. The concept is explained practically through the following examples

1. """estimating_pi.py""" - Given the length of digitals(n) approximate the value of the constant pi to n digits 
2. """stock_price_prediction.py""" - Considering stock price of a company follows binomial model tree with a constant probabilities of the stock price going up(u) and down(d) find the price of the stock after the specified duration
